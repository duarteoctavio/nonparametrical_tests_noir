// Introduction:

Today, scientific research is highly based on trust. Researchers trust the data produced by their colleagues, and the journals trust the research produced by the scientists.

But this trust brought us scientific communities to a huge **reproducibility crisis**.

// Problem:

ðŸš« [A global survey of 1630 biomedical scientists found that from the sciencitist that tried to replicate others experiments, 82% fail.](https://www.science.org/content/article/news-glance-replication-troubles-financial-conflict-disclosures-and-public-health-shake)

ðŸš«[An estimate of more than 700 billion is spent yearly on scientific research in the US alone.](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-much-was-spent-on-research-_K2f_whSTuSzUa1gA8BQNg#0)

ðŸš« [Where studies in preclinical research have shown that more than %15 of this irreproducible research is only due to data analysis and reporting issues.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4461318/#sec003)

[Current Trump administration recognises this as a severe problem, and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. say they want to make replication a pillar of what the institutes do, pointing to fraud in the research community. He claims that at least 20% of the NIH budgets should be use for replication.](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/medical-studies-rfk-nih-replication)

// Momentum:

There are many reasons for this crisis, but one of the most important is that **the scientific community has not yet found a way to trust the data produced by others**. The revalidation process is opaque, costly, and easily manipulated!

**Science should should be proof by design, not by promise.**

Thats why we are building #ReValidate.

// Value proposition:

We are the **#ZK platform for scientific revalidationâ€”auditing protocols**.

Our system creates a way to ensure the process has happened in a sane way, with minimal disruption of the traditional research flow, and with a massive increase in transparency & auditability by using circuits to lock criteria into code, standardizing data analysis with zero trust and using the blockchain for full auditability and transparency.

âœ… Pre-built or custom circuits lock protocol criteria and #statistical analysis in immutable code when revalidation starts.

âœ… On-chain registry are created for statistical runs with every run and dataset cryptographically logged.

âœ… An intuitive an simple platform assists the researchers during protocol audits and data logging process to reduce costs for data audits.

Our system aims to create a new standard for scientific trust: revalidation goes from opaque and manual to transparent, auditable, and cryptographically secure.

Let' see it in action:

// Transition to demo.

...shows the process...

// Transition to conclusion:

We believe that **Science should should be proof by design, not by promise.**

We are building #ReValidate to make this a reality.

Thank you for your time and attention.
