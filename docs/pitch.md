**Science that needs no trust—proof by design, not by promise.**

Science underpins society BUT the revalidation process is opaque, costly, and easily manipulated!

❌ $28 Billion per year spent on preclinical results that cannot be repeated in the U.S. alone.

❌ $28B lost yearly in the US to irreproducible research (Freedman et al., 2015)

❌ TBD

**Revalidate. Solves. This.**

We’re the **#ZK platform for scientific revalidation—auditing protocols**, locking criteria into code, and standardizing data analysis with zero trust, full auditability, and #Web3 security.

✅ Lock protocol criteria and #statistical analysis in immutable code for real #transparency

✅ Standardize and audit #data collection—every run, every dataset, cryptographically logged

✅ Eliminate trust-based loopholes—researchers can’t game the process, #ZKProofs prove authenticity

If blockchains removed trust from money and ZK proofs removed trust from privacy, #Revalidate removes trust from protocol audits in revalidation process itself.

**See how truth becomes auditable and tamperproof in science:**

Key summary:

- Immutable protocol audits: lock statistical criteria and trazability into verifiable circuits—no subjective interpretation, just proof.
- Standardized data analysis: replicators can’t manipulate outcomes or criteria; every step is logged, reproducible, and future-proof.
- A new standard for scientific trust: revalidation goes from opaque and manual to transparent, instant, and cryptographically secure.
