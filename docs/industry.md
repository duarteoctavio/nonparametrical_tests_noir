# Revalidation thesis

**Simple Explanation:**

_The revalidation industry in scientific studies refers to organizations, services, and processes dedicated to independently confirming the results of published scientific research. The goal is to ensure that the findings are credible, reproducible, and reliable before they are widely accepted or used as the basis for further research or policy._

## **What is Revalidation in Science?**

- **Revalidation** (also called _replication_, _confirmation_, or _verification_) means conducting new studies or analyses to check if previously reported scientific results hold true under similar or slightly varied conditions.
- Its primary purpose is to detect and prevent mistakes, fraud, or irreproducible results in the literature.

## **Why Has an Industry Formed?**

- **Replication Crisis:** High-profile failures to replicate key findings (especially in psychology, medicine, and biology) have exposed weaknesses in how science is verified.
- **Pressure for Reliability:** Journals, funders, and the public demand trusted results—particularly in health, pharma, and AI.
- Specialized organizations now offer revalidation as a service to journals, companies, grant agencies, and researchers.

## **Who Are the Key Players?**

| Organization/Type             | Role/Function                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Specialized Service Firms     | Provide independent replication studies on contract |
| Academic Consortia            | Coordinate largescale multi-lab replications        |
| Journals                      | Require or offer replication/validation services    |
| CROs (Clinical Research Orgs) | Replicate/validate clinical study results           |
| Tech Companies                | Validate AI and algorithmic results                 |

**Examples:**

- Center for Open Science (COS)
- Reproducibility Project
- Science Exchange (marketplace for research services)
- Collaborative Replications and Education Project (CREP)

## **What Services Are Offered?**

- **Experimental replication**: Repeating experiments with original or new samples
- **Statistical reanalysis**: Re-checking data with improved or alternative methods
- **Protocol audit:** Reviewing methods for completeness and reproducibility
- **Software code review:** Ensuring computational results can be repeated
- **Data validation**: Confirming data integrity and statistical soundness

## **Who Uses Revalidation Services?**

- _Journals_ (for pre-publication checks)
- _Pharmaceutical companies_ (before investing in costly clinical trials)
- _Academic researchers_ (to boost credibility)
- _Grant agencies_ (to avoid funding unreliable projects)
- _Startups/VC firms_ (to verify ip/tech claims)

## **Challenges and Limitations**

- **Cost and time:** Replications can be expensive and slow.
- **Access to raw data/materials:** Sometimes original data or methods aren’t fully available.
- **Publication bias:** Negative replication results are harder to publish.
- **Complexity:** Some studies are inherently difficult to replicate exactly.

## **Detailed Example: New Revalidation Process in Action**

_Imagine a pharmaceutical company publishes a study claiming that their new drug lowers blood pressure significantly. Before another company invests in developing a similar drug or before regulators approve it, they might hire a revalidation service to independently repeat the study and confirm the results._

### **1. Scenario**

**A research team publishes a paper in a top journal,** showing that a newly discovered compound, "CardioReliefX," **reduces blood pressure by 15% in hypertensive mice.** The results generate excitement in the medical field.

### **2. Trigger for Revalidation**

- **Reason:**
  Several biotech investors and competing companies are interested, **but want to confirm the findings before committing millions to further development.**
- **Approach:**
  They contact a specialized revalidation organization.

### **3. Revalidation Service Steps**

1. **Review and Planning - No offer.**
   - The revalidation firm acquires the published paper and any available supplementary material.
   - They contact the original authors for raw data, detailed protocols, and exact materials (including the exact strain of mice and source of CardioReliefX).
2. **Protocol Audit - Our technique is defined as part of the protocol for audit.**
   - Experts review the methods for completeness and feasibility.
   - Any ambiguities are clarified with the original researchers.
3. **Experimental Replication - No offer.**
   - The service independently sources the mice and CardioReliefX from suppliers.
   - They repeat the experiment using the same dosages, times, and measurement techniques as the original study, but with their own team.
   - All procedures are documented meticulously.
4. **Data Collection & Statistical Analysis - Validation**
   - New data is collected and **analyzed using the same statistical methods from the original paper**, plus additional checks to rule out errors.
   - Results are compared to the published findings.
5. **Reporting**
   - The revalidation service creates a comprehensive report.
   - It details methods, any deviations from the original, all raw data, analysis, and a direct comparison to the published study.
6. **Outcome**
   - _If results are replicated_: The investors gain confidence and may fund the next trial phase.
   - _If results differ_: Concerns are raised, and further investigations (or even retractions) may follow.
