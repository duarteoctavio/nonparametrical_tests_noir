# Noir Verifiers for Non Parametrical Tests

## Why is this useful

  I attach [this interesting article](https://www.chjh.nl/concerns-about-blockchain-for-science/). Even though the author is *against* the hypothesis that blockchain relatad tools can help fix the issue, I believe we are able to address several of the issues he mentions if ZK and some other current blockchain related technologies are considered.

  What i care about is this list of problems he considers most relevant.

- Selective publication.
- **Misrepresentation of the research process (e.g., adjusting predictions after data are available)**.
- Limited, obfuscated, and unequal access to results.
- Messy and restricted preservation.
- Exclusivity of (participating in) scientific research.
- Inequality in research.
- Toxic research evaluations.

  To this list of issues, I will add the very inefficient and greedy monopoly of a fairly small set of publishers, who traditionally ask reviewers to work for free and publishers to pay to be published, as well as the readers to get access to the articles. A monopoly hurting all participants in a system is always a good chance for new alternatives to attract attention.

  I believe there's space to maneuver around most of these issues, as reviewing can be probably improved using semaphores and blockchains offer a several ways to increase persistence, availability and accesibility to publish/emit data (being p2p systems).

  I will focus on the *second* one, as you might have guessed because of the boldening. and the following section's title.
  I'm listing the other ones because I envision this first project as part of a suite that has the ambitious target of offering solutions for all of these problems, while allowing the reasonable practices to be preserved and improved.


## How to stop the *misrepresentation of research processes*

  A ZK contract can do two things to stop this from happening:
  - Level A: The data can  be stored on chain.
  - Level B: The data can be totally hidden even from the researchers if it is 

## An immediate extra benefit: Crowdsourced sensitive data

  The ability to submit data while remaining anonimous opens the door to be able to ask people for their data without creating riks for them.
  A good excample is medical research data. Almost all medical data is delicate and probably nobody would share it willingly because it reveals too much about a person's life, weaknesses, etc.
  This data is of an enormous value, though, and in fact there's a huge benefit in sharing your data: you allow researchers to work on a case similar to yours: yourself.
  Most medical science big data is heavily privatized, acquired by fairly dubious methods from the patients and fragmentary, as once you missapropriate a patients data, which is a crime, you can't approach and politely ask for the missing details.
  Zero knowledge anonimized medical data submission could be a game changer for science.


## Why non parametrical tests, in particular?

# Plan

## Stage 0: Preliminar Research

- Done.

## Stage 1: Code the provers

- This is 75% done.

## Stage 2: Code the contracts.

- This is 50% done, but might be less.

## Stage 3: Tie contracts and a nice frontend to show an MVP application.
